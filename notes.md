# Scanner
> The Scanner's job is to scan the source text and return tokens.

# Compiler
> The Compiler's Job is to take the tokens and return bytes.

# Interpreter
> The Interpreter's job is to take the bytes and interpret them.


# Ideas
> - Save all the bytes in a file and then just interpret them instead of scanning, compiling..
> - Try to always make the language simpler than Python.
> - Try to make the language fast and efficient.
> - Make it possible to remove all runtime libraries, like: no libc in C++, CoreRT in C#...
