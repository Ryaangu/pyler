## 💻 pyler
> A simple compiler made in Python.

## 🤔 How to use?
> Go to `pyler` directory and type: `cmd\run_python.cmd` in a command line.

## ⌨ Hello World Example
```py
1. print "Hello, World!"
2. \0
```
> ⚠ **NOTE**: `\0` tells the compiler to compile the code you wrote.

## ⌨ Variables Example
```py
1. # This is a variable that is forced to be global
2. global a = "Hello! I'm a global variable :D"
3. # This is a global variable because it's not inside a block
4. var b = "I'm global? >:o"
5. # This is a local variable because it's inside a block
6. {
7.     var c = "I'm local... :("
8. }
```

## ⌨ Statements Example
```py
1. # This is an If Statement!
2. if (true == true)
3.     print true;
4. else
5.     print false;
```

## 📝 To do
> 1. [x] Better variable declaration.
> 2. [x] Global and Local variables. (they are global right now)
> 3. [ ] For Statement.
> 4. [ ] While Statement.
> 5. [ ] Functions.
